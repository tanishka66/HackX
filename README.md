Brain Signal
This project focuses on analyzing brain signals to identify attention levels using EEG data. It involves developing and evaluating three different models: EEGNet, a CNN-RNN hybrid model, and a Random Forest model. The goal is to create accurate and reliable models for attention identification and provide comprehensive performance metrics.

Datasets include a separate training dataset and experimental dataset.
